# The Wonders Of Git

We have seen that the website on the **.100** host is a copy of the one on the webserver. We know the webserver copy is outdated but that doesn't mean the **.100** host copy isn't more up to date. 

Given we have access to the webserver we can just grab the source code from there. Taking a look around, we come across the file in the directory **C:\GitStack\Repositories\Website.gt**. From here we can download it with the inbuilt download feature in Evil-WinRM by doing **download C:\GitStack\Repositories\Website.gt**
