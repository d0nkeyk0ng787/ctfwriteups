# Empire: Interactive Shell

Empire has a built in feature that provides an interactive shell to the user. Essentially it allows for the access to a pseudo-command shell either from Starkiller or the EmpireCLI

From this interactive shell, the user can execute powershell commands as you would in any powershell reverse shell

This interactive shell can be accessed straight from the Agent interaction page under the **Interact** section
