### Network IPs & Informatiom

IP 1: 10.200.196.200

There are three machines on the network
There is at least one public facing webserver
There is a self-hosted git server somewhere on the network
The git server is internal, so Thomas may have pushed sensitive information into it
There is a PC running on the network that has antivirus installed, meaning we can hazard a guess that this is likely to be Windows
By the sounds of it this is likely to be the server variant of Windows, which might work in our favour
The (assumed) Windows PC cannot be accessed directly from the webserver
